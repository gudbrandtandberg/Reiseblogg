          <h2>Arabia <small>19.8.2015</small></h2>
            <p>
              After a lovely farewell dinner with family and friends, we finally set off for the Arabian Peninsula.
              Our trip was a fine one, and we were very happy to finally be greeted by Nora and Steven at the airport.
              The first thing that hit us were the Dishdashas and Abayas, the local clothing. Made us
              think of <a href="https://media.snl.no/system/images/3750/standard_flaaklypa.jpg">Sheikh Ben Reddik Fy Fasan</a>. 
              The second thing that hit us was the hot and humid weather. 40+&deg;C! - say no more!
            </p>
            
            <p>
            On our first day in Abu Dhabi we went to friday brunch - a foodfeast without like! As all the muslims are
            off praying in the mosque, the expats and tourists enjoy unlimited food and drink in the city's hotels.
            We filled our bellies as we never have before, with food from almost every corner of the world. Among the
            winners were <a href="http://honestcooking.com/um-ali-egyptian-bread-pudding/">Um Ali</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanafeh">Kalafeh</a> and 
            <a href="http://bennydoro.com/chef/recipes/moutabal-roasted-eggplant-dip/">Moutabal</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            At 4:00 the next morning we hopped in a desert-bound Toyota Landcruiser driven by a friendly Indian gentleman.
            After an hours peaceful drive through the desert highway we took a sharp right into the sand dunes. Fear
            and panic filled the vehicle as the driver cranked the volume to the max and went bashing up and down and round
            and round in the dunes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Click the sunrise for a short video!</span>
            </p>
            
            <div id="links">
                <a href="bilder/diverse/bashing.mp4"
                    title="Dune Bashing"
                    data-gallery
                    type="video/mp4"

            </div>
            
            <p>
            Eventually we came to a pause on the top
            of a dune to enjoy an epic desert sunrise not unlike that of Tatooine.
            </p>
            
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="artpic" src="bilder/arabia/IMG_8049.JPG" /></div>
              <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="artpic" src="bilder/diverse/tatooine.jpg" /></div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
            Later we went for a drive around Abu Dhabi with our excellent tour guides - The Pottsbergs. After a tour
            of this most remarkable city we ended up at the Emirates Palace Hotel &mdash; one of only two seven star hotels
            in the world (the other being in Dubai) &mdash; for our afternoon tea. The thing about this hotel is gold.
            Gold-to-go ATM's, gold walls, gold paintings, gold furniture, gold food, but dissapointingly only silver spoons...
            </p>
            
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <img class="artpic" src="bilder/diverse/gold.jpg" />
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <img class="artpic" src="bilder/diverse/gold2.jpg" />
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
            At this time, The Pottsbergs had to go back to work, so we headed north. And then west. First stop was
            Dubai. Dubai was unbearable in many ways. Because of the extreme heat we spent the day rushing between
            cafés and malls in complete cultural shock. Somewhere between the extremes of capitalism gone mad and
            outdated religious tradition sat we, wondering how this could even be possible. In the evening however
            we found the older parts of the city where we enjoyed walking around a maze of spice and gold markets
            among friendly locals in the Souq of Dubai. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <img class="artpic" src="bilder/diverse/souq.jpg" />
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
            At the end of the day we jumped on a flight to Muskat, the capital city in the Sultanate of Oman.
            Muskat stood in stark contrast to the city we had just left. Tucked away inbetween beautiful mountain
            scenery and the Arabian sea lies a city with a highly visible cultural history and proud, hard-working,
            friendly people. Although we never got to use our background story, we pretended to be newlyweds on our
            honeymoon in the hotel we stayed at, in order to sleep in the same room. Thanks again to the Pottsbergs
            for the hotel gift.
            </p>
            
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <img class="artpic" src="bilder/diverse/muskat.jpg" />
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
            During our day we went to the old city, where they had a cultural museum, several old
            portugese forts, and one of Sultan Qaboos' palaces. We ended up in a museum chronicling the long and
            complicated French-Omani relationship. Several rooms were dedicated solely to pictures of the state visit
            between Mitterrand and Sultan Qaboos of January '89. Later on we went to <a href="https://www.google.co.th/search?q=muscat+souq&espv=2&biw=1218&bih=679&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI1Nfum9G5xwIVShmOCh0_mQhV#tbm=isch&q=muttrah+souq">
            Muttrah Souq</a>, an intricate web of
            narrow market streets with shops selling antiques, jewlery, spices, clothing, fabrics, incence (Oman is
            famous for its frankincense, notably brought as a gift to baby Jesus back in the day), and much much more.
            We ended our day at a wonderful arabic restaurant with shish kebab, peppermint tea, shisha and Um Ali. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              After heading back to Abu Dhabi and enjoying a few more days lazing indoors, we are setting of for the next
              leg of our journey - Bangkok, Thailand! Stay tuned for more updates coming soon xoxo G & S
