<h3>The Mysteries of Bali</h3>

<p>
Although Bali to many people is a place of party, beachlife and Bintang beer it is also home to the most complex and interesting religion and culture I have ever gotten to know. In this article I will try to explain some parts of their extensive culture, rituals and beliefs. It will in no way cover all there is to say about the subject but merely the ones we encountered on our one-month travel through this charming little island.
</p>
 

<h4>Names</h4>

<p>
Brothers and sisters don't necessaraly have the same last name. This is because there are no actual family names here. The parents decide on the individual last names at least three months after the birth of the child. That gives them enough time to get to know the child and give an appropriate name. Some names are given according to the looks of the child like Apel (apple) if the child is fat. Others get names based on their whims or the goodness of their heart.
</p>
 
<p>
As you see the parents have a lot of freedom when it comes to choosing a last name, but they have very little choice when it comes to first names. First names are given according to rank of birth. The first child is named Wayan or Putu. Gede is also possible but only for boys. The second child is named Made or Kadek, the third Nyoman or Komang and the fourth Ketut. What if there is a fifth child? Well, then they start all over again.
</p>
 
<p>
We learned this fact last time we where in Bali, three years ago, but traveling around so much this time we where taken aback by the amount of Ketuts we met and by all the "Made's Warung" (Made's restaurant) all over Bali. You would think this made it easier to remember names, but I found it rather difficult.

<h4>
    Balinese Hinduism

</h4>

 
<p>
According to Balinese beliefs, the Gods left them the earth, but in exchange, they count on them to maintain the balance of it.
</p>
 
<p>
The earth is seen as a big ball resting on a huge turtle called Bedawang. Around its feet are coiled two large guardian snakes - the Nagas. Way above the earth, at the top of the Agung volcano, the Gods and the ancestors dwell. Human beings only occupy the intermediate part, that they lent us, where demons are free to come and cause damage. Sometimes, when everything is going wrong, the turtle wakes up and starts moving, which causes earthquakes. To make them cease as quickly as possible, the balinese must make a lot of noise in order to wake up the two guardian snakes.
</p>
 
<p>
But that is not all! In order to fullfill their mission they must endeavour to not only honour the Gods, but also pay attention to appease the demons that are prowling about. They are both very numerous, so that means a lot of work!
</p>
 
<p>
In Bali, there is a God for nearly everything and every God has its own day when they are celebrated. There are too many of them for me to mention them all but take Brahma for example. He  is the God of moving metal objects, like motorbikes and cars. So whenever they buy a new vehicle there is a ceremony in its honour so that the vehicle will be protected.

We came to Ubud on the first of three days of the September Celebrations. All over town men and women dressed up in traditional clothing getting ready to visit the temple. The women carried pyramid-shaped offerings on their heads consisting of fruits, cakes, eggs and sometimes entire chickens and walked to the temple to have their offerings blessed. We weren't let into the temple but we stood outside of one of the larger ones stunned by the show of people and a traditional music orchestra (press play to listen!).

<p>
As  I mentiond, pleasing the Gods isn't the only concern of the Balinese hindus, and the demons must also be paid sufficient attention to. That is why they every day, at home and work, after placing offerings to the Gods in raised shrines, place offerings on the ground. These are intended for the demons. Each basket must contain flower petals and sweet foods, be sprinkled with holy water and topped with an incense stick and sometimes a little something they think the demons will enjoy.

<p>
The offerings are placed on the floor because it is the most impure part of the earth, but the demons wander just about everywhere. The demons are only capable of moving in a straight line and this is why you will often meet a wall entering through a door in a balinese home and either go to the left or right to enter the room. Apparently they like hanging out at crossroads and cause a lot of accidents and when this happens a priest quickly shows up and performs a ceremony. They also put roosters on the side of the road inside large bamboo-woven basket cages. I haven't completely understood the direct effect of this act, but it either makes the demons happy or keeps them out of the house.
